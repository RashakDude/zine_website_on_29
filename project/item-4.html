		<h2>Autonomous Quadcopter</h2>
		<em></em>
		<p>
			Quad copters are really interesting topic for engineering students as it can perform versatile day to day functions. Also the military use of these type of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has grown because of their ability to operate in dangerous locations while keeping their human operators at a safe distance.
A quadcopter, also called quadrotor helicopter is multi-rotor copter with four arms, each of which have a motor and a propeller at their ends. Quadcopters are similar to helicopters in some ways, though their lift and thrust comes from four propellers, rather than just one.
1. Our idea is to design the quadcopter that when left in unknown terrains can give us live video stream on our laptops and also store it according to the need.
2. Automate it so that it can act by judging its surroundings, perform various actions/maneuverers by determining its position and environment.
3. These quad copters can be sent in evacuated buildings and in bio-chemical factories to act as first respondents, and call for cajole by manoeuvring either autonomously or controlling it through Brain.
4. It can also be used to autonomously model unknown environments using distance measuring sensors and decide its path accordingly.
