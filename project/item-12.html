		<em>About</em>
		<p>
			Energy Efficiency-Microcontroller based Android App controlled Solar Tracking System enables the solar panels to track the sun for maximum energy and the power generated is available to the user android based application for manual modifications and control.
Using Self Orienting Solar Panels lead to an enhancement of up to 40% in the generated solar power. Dual axis tracking is an additional feature which makes the design work for any season throughout the year thus accounting for the sunâ€™s deviation during winters.
